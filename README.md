##What is it?##
GameCore is a plugin API (which is a plugin) designed to make creating Minigames eaiser. Every Minigame has a core, For example:
Most (if not all) Minigames require three things
* Arena Management (Creation, Deletion, etc)
* Player Handling
* Scoreboard Management

###The project is split into two packages###
 1. The API for other plugins
 2. The plugin itself
